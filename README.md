Ever forget when you last watered the plants, paid a bill, or called a relative? **When Did I?** is a smart, voice-powered logbook for Amazon Alexa that takes the mental load off remembering life's small but important tasks.

This skill uses the Google Gemini API to understand natural language queries, allowing users to log and retrieve activities without needing to remember specific phrases or dates.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js on AWS Lambda
- **Voice Platform:** Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) SDK v2 for Node.js
- **Database:** Amazon DynamoDB for persistent, user-specific storage.
- **Natural Language Understanding:** Google Gemini API for intelligent querying and task matching.
- **Permissions:** AWS IAM for secure access between services.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Deployment

### Prerequisites

- [Amazon Developer Account](https://developer.amazon.com/)
- [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later recommended)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), configured with your credentials.
- [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) or Google Cloud project to obtain a Gemini API Key.

### 1. Backend Setup (AWS)

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
    cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create DynamoDB Table:**
    Create a DynamoDB table to store user tasks.
    - **Table Name:** `when-did-i-tasks` (or your choice)
    - **Primary Key:** `userId` (String)

4.  **Create IAM Role for Lambda:**
    Create an IAM role that your Lambda function will use. Attach the following policies:
    - `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` (for CloudWatch logs)
    - A custom inline policy granting access to your DynamoDB table:
      ```json
      {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
              {
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Action": [
                      "dynamodb:GetItem",
                      "dynamodb:PutItem",
                      "dynamodb:UpdateItem",
                      "dynamodb:DeleteItem",
                      "dynamodb:Query"
                  ],
                  "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:table/YOUR_TABLE_NAME"
              }
          ]
      }
      ```

5.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `lambda` directory and add your credentials.
    ```
    # .env
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_google_gemini_api_key"
    DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME="when-did-i-tasks"
    ```

6.  **Deploy the Lambda Function:**
    Zip the contents of the `lambda` directory and upload it to a new AWS Lambda function.
    - **Runtime:** Node.js 18.x
    - **Handler:** `index.handler`
    - **Execution Role:** Use the IAM role you created in the previous step.
    - **Add a trigger:** Select "Alexa Skills Kit".

### 2. Frontend Setup (Alexa Developer Console)

1.  Create a new Alexa skill in the [Alexa Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask).
2.  Choose **Custom** model and **Provision your own** backend.
3.  Go to the **Interaction Model > JSON Editor** tab and paste the contents of `skill-package/interactionModels/custom/en-US.json`.
4.  In the **Endpoint** section, paste the ARN of the Lambda function you deployed.
5.  Under the **Permissions** tab, enable **"System > Timezone"**.
6.  Save the model, build it, and start testing!

## üé§ Usage

You can interact with the skill in two primary ways:

#### Method 1: Open and Interact (Conversational)

1.  **You:** "Alexa, open When Did I"
2.  **Alexa:** "Welcome to When Did I. What would you like to log or ask?"
3.  **You:** "Log that I watered the roses" or "When did I last pay rent?"

#### Method 2: Direct Commands (One-Shot)

1.  **You:** "Alexa, tell When Did I that I watered the garden"
2.  **Alexa:** "Okay, I've logged that you watered the garden."

---

*Later that week...*

**You:** "Alexa, ask When Did I when I last tended to the plants?"
**Alexa:** *(Progressive Response)* "Let me search through your activity log... *(Final Response)* You logged 'watered the garden' on Tuesday, August 6th at 2:30 PM."
